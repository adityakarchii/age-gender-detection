# Notes:
# - Core requirements (opencv-python, numpy) are sufficient for basic functionality
# - Uncomment optional libraries based on your specific needs
# - Version ranges ensure compatibility while allowing updates
# - All optional dependencies are commented to keep installation minimal
# - For production deployment, consider pinning to exact versions
